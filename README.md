# JoystickTestMod

A mod for 1.17.1
This mod is just for learning purposes.
If you have a comment/suggestion please post it in the comments section of the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/joysticktestmod "CurseForge") I am always looking to improve and learn!

Adds:
- Nothing Item [MISC] (Used to craft the Nothing Block)
- Nothing Block [DECORATIONS] (Breaks with a Hoe, drops 2-4 Nothing Items)
- Nothing Food [FOOD] (Edible, gives speed 25 for 30 seconds, smelted into Nothing Items)


Also check out the [To-Do List](https://github.com/Joystick299/JoystickTestMod/blob/master/todo.md "To-Do List") for things that I will be doing in the future!
